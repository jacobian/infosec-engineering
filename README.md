# InfoSec Engineering Reading List

A reading list for InfoSec engineers.

This is *my* list, not a definitive one; that is, these are resources I've found useful. As such it has some baises:

- It's oriented towards providers of Software-, Platform-, and Infrastructure-as-a-Service.
- It tends to focus on the human factors aspects of security practice (there's deeply technical stuff too, just not as much).
- There's some random stuff that's not explicitly "about infosec", but that I've nonetheless found extremely useful in thinking about infosec. Dekker's *Field Guide to Understanding 'Human Error'* is a good example of this kind of resource. 

Stars :star: indicate especially good "starting point" resources - things to read first as an introduction to the topic.
